"""
PlotPlay runtime engine package.

This module encapsulates the new engine implementation that replaces the legacy
app.core.game_engine/GameEngine once the refactor completes. All new gameplay
logic, services, and turn orchestration live under this namespace so we can work
in parallel without touching the old engine modules.
