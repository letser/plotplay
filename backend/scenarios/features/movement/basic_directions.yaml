    intro: "You step onto the sunlit cafe patio. The aroma of fresh coffee fills the air. You spot Alex at one of the tables."
    move_north: "You walk through the doorway into the coffee shop. The wooden counter stretches before you, lined with pastries."
    move_south: "You step back outside onto the patio. The fresh air and sunshine greet you."
    move_east: "You weave between tables toward the quiet corner. Soft light filters through the window here."
    move_west: "You return to the main counter area. The hum of coffee grinders fills the space."
