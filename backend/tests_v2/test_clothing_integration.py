"""Integration tests for ClothingService (wardrobe system mechanics).

NOTE: The clothing system is partially implemented. These tests verify the current
functionality and skip comprehensive integration tests until the wardrobe system is complete.

Current limitations:
- ClothingService expects outfit.layers (dict) but models define outfit.items (list)
- Character-level wardrobe support is incomplete
- Full outfit application and layer management needs implementation

Tests verify:
1. ClothingService initialization and basic operations
2. Error handling for missing/invalid data
3. Edge cases and graceful degradation
