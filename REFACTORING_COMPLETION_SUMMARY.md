# PlotPlay Refactoring Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Backend refactoring ~85% complete, ready for frontend work

## Work Completed Today

### 1. Fixed Event Pipeline Test ✅
- **Issue**: Event model was trying to access non-existent `event.narrative` and `event.effects` fields
- **Fix**:
  - Changed to use `event.beats` for narrative text
  - Changed to use `event.on_entry` for effects
  - Added `parse_effect()` helper to handle dict-to-model parsing for effects
  - Updated test fixtures to use correct field names

### 2. Money Meter Auto-Creation ✅
- **Issue**: Economy system required manual money meter definition
- **Fix**: Added automatic money meter initialization in `StateManager._initialize_characters()` when `economy.enabled=true`
- **Location**: `/app/core/state_manager.py:264-267`

### 3. Shopping Effects Implementation ✅
- **Issue**: `inventory_purchase` and `inventory_sell` effects were defined but not wired
- **Fix**:
  - Added `_apply_purchase()` and `_apply_sell()` handlers in `EffectResolver`
  - Implemented money deduction/addition logic
  - Integrated with existing inventory service
  - Respects economy max_money caps
  - Validates sufficient funds before purchase
- **Location**: `/app/engine/effects.py:226-317`

## Current Test Status

- **Passing**: 140/140 (100%)
- **Skipped**: 22 (intentionally deferred - awaiting advanced features)
  - 10 economy tests (require shop UI integration)
  - 7 clothing tests (require advanced clothing features)
  - 5 clothing service tests (require outfit slot merging)

## Spec Coverage Summary

### ✅ Complete (14 systems)
- Expression DSL & Conditions
- Meters
- Flags
- Time & Calendar
- Items & Inventory
- Locations & Zones
- Characters
- Effects (now including purchase/sell)
- Modifiers
- Nodes
- Events
- Arcs & Milestones
- AI Contracts (Writer & Checker)
- Actions

### ⚠️ Partial (2 systems)
1. **Clothing System** (~60% complete)
   - Basic clothing works
   - Missing: outfit slot merging, concealment, can_open enforcement

2. **Economy/Shopping** (~70% complete)
   - Money meter: ✅ Auto-created
   - Purchase/sell effects: ✅ Implemented
   - Missing: Shop UI/service integration, shop availability conditions

## Architecture Status

### Backend Engine
- ✅ Service-oriented architecture complete
- ✅ TurnManager orchestrates full pipeline
- ✅ All core services extracted and functional
- ✅ Effect resolution handles all effect types
- ✅ State management solid
- ⚠️ Clothing service needs outfit slot merging fix

### Frontend
- ⏳ Stage 6 not started (blocked by backend completion)
- Needs API contract updates
- Needs UI component refactoring for dynamic meters

## Known Issues

### Critical (P0)
None - all critical systems functional

### High Priority (P1)
1. **Clothing Outfit Model Mismatch**
   - Models define `Outfit.items` as list
   - Service expects `outfit.layers` as dict
   - Affects 12 tests
   - Complexity: Medium (3-4 hours)

### Medium Priority (P2)
1. **Shop System Integration**
   - Shop models exist
   - Effects work
   - Need shop service for UI integration
   - Complexity: High (4-6 hours)

2. **Legacy Tests Folder**
   - `backend/tests/` contains 26 files (~17k LOC) from old architecture
   - Decision needed: keep for reference or delete
   - Recommendation: Archive to separate branch, then delete

## Next Steps

### Immediate (blocking frontend work)
1. Fix clothing outfit slot merging (3-4 hours)
2. Delete or archive legacy tests folder (30 minutes)
3. Update CLAUDE.md with current status

### Short-term (nice to have)
1. Implement remaining shop service features
2. Add advanced clothing features (concealment, locks)
3. Complete frontend Stage 6

## Files Modified Today

- `/app/engine/events.py` - Fixed event narrative/effects handling
- `/app/models/effects.py` - Added parse_effect() helper
- `/app/models/nodes.py` - Updated import handling for effects
- `/app/core/state_manager.py` - Added money meter auto-creation
- `/app/engine/effects.py` - Added purchase/sell effect handlers
- `/tests_v2/conftest.py` - Fixed event fixtures

## Recommendations

### For User
1. **Delete legacy tests**: The new tests_v2/ suite is comprehensive. Archive old tests to a branch if needed for reference.
2. **Prioritize clothing fix**: Blocks 12 tests and is a core system.
3. **Defer shop UI**: Effects work, UI integration can wait.
4. **Start frontend Stage 6**: Backend is stable enough to begin frontend refactoring.

### For Future Development
1. Consider adding integration tests for purchase/sell workflows
2. Document money meter auto-creation in specification
3. Add shop availability condition examples to test games
