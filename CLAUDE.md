## Project Overview

PlotPlay is an AI-driven text adventure engine that combines branching narratives with AI-generated prose. The engine enforces deterministic state management (meters, flags, clothing, inventory) while using a two-model AI architecture (Writer for prose, Checker for state validation) to generate interactive fiction experiences.
