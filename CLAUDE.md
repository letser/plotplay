# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PlotPlay is an AI-driven text adventure engine that combines branching narratives with AI-generated prose. The engine enforces deterministic state management (meters, flags, clothing, inventory) while using a two-model AI architecture (Writer for prose, Checker for state validation) to generate interactive fiction experiences.

## Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

The backend follows a **service-oriented architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

- **`app/engine/`** - Core game engine services (new modular design):
  - `runtime.py` - Session management and shared runtime context
  - `turn_manager.py` - Orchestrates the full turn processing pipeline
  - `effects.py` - Resolves effects (meter changes, flags, inventory, etc.)
  - `movement.py` - Handles player/NPC movement between locations
  - `time.py` - Time progression and calendar management
  - `choices.py` - Generates available player choices
  - `events.py` - Event/arc triggering and milestone tracking (consolidated EventManager + ArcManager)
  - `nodes.py` - Node transitions and execution
  - `narrative.py` - AI narrative generation and reconciliation
  - `discovery.py` - Discovery logging and context building
  - `presence.py` - Character presence and privacy validation
  - `state_summary.py` - State snapshot formatting for API responses
  - `action_formatter.py` - Formats player actions for AI context
  - `prompt_builder.py` - Constructs AI prompts with state context
  - `inventory.py` - Inventory management service (migrated from InventoryManager)
  - `clothing.py` - Clothing state service (migrated from ClothingManager)
  - `modifiers.py` - Modifier management service (migrated from ModifierManager)

- **`app/core/`** - Core utilities and foundation:
  - `game_engine.py` - Main engine façade that composes services
  - `game_loader.py` / `game_validator.py` - Load and validate game YAML files
  - `state_manager.py` - Game state persistence and updates
  - `conditions.py` - Expression DSL evaluator for conditional logic

- **`app/models/`** - Pydantic data models (characters, items, nodes, effects, etc.)
- **`app/api/`** - FastAPI route handlers (`game.py`, `health.py`, `debug.py`)
- **`app/services/`** - External integrations (AI service for LLM calls)

### Frontend (React/TypeScript/Vite)

- **`src/components/`** - React UI components (NarrativePanel, ChoicePanel, CharacterPanel, GameInterface)
- **`src/stores/`** - Zustand state management (`gameStore.ts`)
- **`src/services/`** - API client (`gameApi.ts` for backend communication)

### Game Content

- **`games/`** - Game content folders (each contains `game.yaml` manifest + split YAML files for nodes, characters, locations, etc.)
- **`shared/`** - Shared specifications (`plotplay_specification.md` - comprehensive engine spec)

### Test Suite

**`backend/tests/`** - Modern, service-oriented test suite
- Run with: `pytest backend/tests/`
- Tests all engine services in `app/engine/`
- Shared fixtures in `conftest.py` and `conftest_services.py`
- **Current status**: 145/145 tests passing, 17 skipped (stub implementations)
- **Coverage**: All core systems tested

## Key Design Patterns

### GameEngine as Façade

`GameEngine` (app/core/game_engine.py) is a façade that composes specialized services. The core turn processing flow is delegated to `TurnManager` (app/engine/turn_manager.py), which orchestrates:

1. Action formatting (ActionFormatter)
2. Node transitions (NodeService)
3. Effect resolution (EffectResolver)
4. Event/arc processing (EventPipeline)
5. Movement (MovementService)
6. Time progression (TimeService)
7. Narrative generation (NarrativeReconciler)
8. Discovery logging (DiscoveryService)
9. Choice generation (ChoiceService)

### Condition Evaluation

The Expression DSL (app/core/conditions.py) evaluates conditions against game state. Use the helper methods `evaluate_conditions()`, `evaluate_all()`, `evaluate_any()` instead of manually building boolean logic.

### State Management

- Game state is the single source of truth (meters, flags, modifiers, inventory, clothing, location, time, arcs)
- `StateManager` (app/core/state_manager.py) handles updates and persistence
- State is validated against game definition - unknown keys/values are rejected

### AI Integration

- Two-model architecture: Writer (prose generation) and Checker (state validation)
- `PromptBuilder` constructs prompts with full state context (character cards, location info, node metadata)
- `AIService` (app/services/ai_service.py) handles LLM API calls

## Working on Prompts (Next Phase)

### AI Architecture Overview

PlotPlay uses a **two-model architecture** for AI-generated content:

1. **Writer Model** - Generates narrative prose
   - Input: Full game context (state, character cards, location, recent history)
   - Output: 1-3 paragraphs of story text
   - Role: Creates engaging, immersive narrative

2. **Checker Model** - Validates and extracts state changes
   - Input: Writer's prose + game context
   - Output: Structured state changes (meters, flags, clothing, etc.)
   - Role: Ensures narrative doesn't contradict game rules

### Key Files for Prompt Work

**Prompt Construction**:
- `app/engine/prompt_builder.py` - Builds prompts with full game context
  - Includes character cards, location info, state snapshot
  - Formats recent history and player action
  - Provides Writer guidance (beats, narration rules)

**AI Service Integration**:
- `app/services/ai_service.py` - Handles LLM API calls
  - Supports multiple providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Configurable via `.env` (WRITER_MODEL, CHECKER_MODEL)

**Narrative Processing**:
- `app/engine/narrative.py` - NarrativeReconciler service
  - Calls Writer and Checker in sequence
  - Reconciles Checker changes with game state
  - Handles validation and error cases

**Turn Pipeline**:
- `app/engine/turn_manager.py` - Orchestrates full turn flow
  - Narrative generation is step 7 of 9
  - All state is available for prompt context

### Current Prompt Status

**Writer Contract**: Stable
- Receives full game context in structured format
- Expected to return narrative prose only
- No state extraction required from Writer

**Checker Contract**: Stable
- Receives Writer's prose + game context
- Expected to return structured JSON with state changes
- Validates changes against game rules

**Known Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Specification may not reflect latest prompt features
- ✅ Actual prompt builder has wider feature set than spec documents
- ✅ Both models work correctly with current implementation

### Recommended Prompt Improvements

Based on the current architecture, focus areas for improvement:

1. **Writer Prompt Optimization**
   - Refine character card format for better consistency
   - Improve beat integration (guidance bullets)
   - Optimize context window usage (what to include/exclude)

2. **Checker Prompt Optimization**
   - Improve state change extraction accuracy
   - Refine clothing state detection
   - Better handling of implicit actions

3. **Context Management**
   - Optimize recent history length
   - Fine-tune state snapshot detail level
   - Balance context size vs. quality

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create prompt test scenarios
   - Measure consistency across model types
   - Validate edge cases (complex scenes, multiple characters)

### How to Test Prompt Changes

```bash
# Run backend with test game
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Use the college_romance game (has all features)
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs
# Test via /api/game/start and /api/game/action endpoints

# Monitor logs for prompt content
# Logs show actual prompts sent to Writer/Checker

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/test_ai_integration.py -v
pytest tests/test_narrative_reconciler.py -v
```

### Prompt Testing Workflow

1. **Make prompt changes** in `prompt_builder.py`
2. **Start a test game** via API
3. **Take actions** and observe Writer/Checker outputs
4. **Check logs** to see actual prompts sent
5. **Validate** that state changes are correctly detected
6. **Iterate** based on results

### Working Directory Context

- Backend commands should be run from the `backend/` directory
- Frontend commands should be run from the `frontend/` directory
- Docker commands should be run from the project root
- The game engine resolves game paths differently in Docker vs native mode (see `backend/app/core/env.py`)

### Frontend Improvement Plan

**Status**: ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETE!

#### **Phase 1: Custom Hooks & Code Organization** ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Extract repeated snapshot access patterns into reusable hooks.

**Tasks**:
1. Create custom hooks for snapshot data access:
   - `usePlayer()` → returns `snapshot.player` with type safety
   - `usePresentCharacters()` → returns `snapshot.characters`
   - `useLocation()` → returns `snapshot.location`
   - `useTimeInfo()` → returns `snapshot.time`
   - `useSnapshot()` → returns full snapshot with null check

2. Extract utility functions:
   - Meter color mapping (currently duplicated in PlayerPanel/CharacterPanel)
   - Icon helpers
   - Text formatting (capitalize, title case, etc.)

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner, more maintainable component code
- Better reusability across components
- Easier unit testing
- Consistent null handling

**Location**: `frontend/src/hooks/`

**Results**: All custom hooks implemented and tested (100% coverage)

#### **Phase 2: Error Handling & UX Polish** ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Graceful error handling and improved user feedback.

**Tasks**:
1. **Add React Error Boundaries**:
   - Wrap major UI sections (GameInterface, panels)
   - Show friendly fallback UI instead of blank screens
   - Log errors to console for debugging
   - Optional: Send errors to error tracking service

2. **Improve Loading States**:
   - Centralized loading component/spinner
   - Skeleton screens for panels during initial load
   - Better feedback during AI generation (show "AI is thinking...")
   - Disable actions during loading to prevent double-submission

3. **Add State Persistence**:
   - Save session to localStorage on every turn
   - Allow session recovery on browser refresh
   - "Resume game" functionality on homepage
   - Clear session on explicit "End Game"

**Benefits**:
- Better UX for users (no lost progress)
- Professional error handling
- Clear feedback on long-running operations

**Results**: Error boundaries, LoadingSpinner, SkeletonLoader, localStorage persistence all implemented

#### **Phase 3: Testing & Reliability** ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Comprehensive test coverage for frontend components.

**Tasks**:
1. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Test `ChoicePanel` component (say/do modes, quick actions)
   - Test `InventoryPanel` actions (use/drop/give)
   - Test `gameStore` async actions (purchase, move, give)
   - Test custom hooks (once created in Phase 1)
   - Test error boundaries

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test full user flows (start game → take actions → end game)
   - Test API error handling
   - Test state persistence/recovery

**Tools**:
- Jest (already configured)
- React Testing Library
- Mock localStorage

**Results**: 69 tests passing (100% pass rate), excellent coverage on hooks (100%), utils (90.78%), components (78.16%)

   - Ctrl+K to focus input field
   - Number keys 1-9 to activate quick actions
   - Visual hints next to quick action buttons

3. **✅ Optimistic Updates**:
   - Movement actions show immediately in turn log
   - "Moving to [destination]..." placeholder
   - Replaced with actual response on success
   - Reverted on error with toast notification

4. **✅ Animations & Transitions**:
   - Fade-in-up animation for new turn entries

### Frontend Development Workflow

```bash
# Setup
cd frontend
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev
# UI at http://localhost:5173

# Type checking and build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Frontend Code Style

- Four-space indentation
- PascalCase for components
- camelCase for functions/variables/hooks
- Custom hooks prefixed with `use`
- Zustand stores named `use<Feature>Store`
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No unused variables/imports (enforced by tsconfig)

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

**State Management**:
- Zustand for global state (game session, turn log, choices)
- React hooks for local component state
- No prop drilling (use store or custom hooks)

**Data Flow**:
```
User Action → Component → Store → API Service → Backend
Backend Response → Store → Component Re-render
```

**Snapshot-First Design**:
- All components read from `gameState.snapshot`
- No fallbacks to legacy state structure
- Components return null if snapshot unavailable

**Type Safety**:
- All API responses typed (in `services/gameApi.ts`)
- All store actions typed
- Components use proper interfaces

---

## Environment Configuration

Before running the backend, copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and configure:
- AI model API keys (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Model identifiers for Writer and Checker
- Optional: logging levels, game paths

Never commit `.env` files or API keys to the repository.

## Common Gotchas

### Path Management for Games

The engine supports loading games from different paths in Docker vs. native modes. Game paths are resolved via environment variables. Check `backend/app/core/env.py` for path resolution logic.

### Prompt Builder Hardening

`PromptBuilder` has been hardened to handle missing/minimal game data. It won't crash if world info, meters, or modifiers are absent - test fixtures can be minimal.

### Logger Persistence

Logger uses `NullHandler` on permission errors. FastAPI error handling should be audited since logger may not always write to disk.

### Two Example Games

- `games/coffeeshop_date/` - Minimal example conforming to v3 spec
- `games/college_romance/` - Full-featured example with all systems

Use these as references when building game content or testing.

## Code Style

### Python
- Python 3.11+
- Four-space indentation
- Type hints required
- snake_case for modules/functions/variables
- PascalCase for classes
- Service classes follow `<Feature>Service` pattern
- Tests follow `test_<feature>.py` naming

### TypeScript/React
- Four-space indentation
- PascalCase for components
- camelCase for functions/variables/hooks
- Zustand stores named `use<Feature>Store`
- Colocate stores in `stores/`, services in `services/`

## Testing Philosophy

- **Unit tests** for individual services (condition evaluation, effects, movement)
- **Integration tests** for service composition (turn manager, event pipeline)
- **Fixture-based** - reusable game definitions in conftest files
- **Spec-driven** - tests validate against `shared/plotplay_specification.md`

### When Adding Features

1. Add Pydantic models in `app/models/`
2. Add service logic in `app/engine/` (or extend existing service)
3. Add tests in `tests/` with fixtures
4. Update game YAML schema if needed
5. Update `shared/plotplay_specification.md`

### Test Fixture Organization

- `tests/conftest.py` - Core game definition fixtures (minimal games, characters, locations)
- `tests/conftest_services.py` - Engine service fixtures (runtime, managers, composed engine)
- Individual test files can add specialized fixtures as needed

## API Structure

Backend exposes three routers:
- `/api/health` - Health checks
- `/api/game` - Game session management (start, action, state)
- `/api/debug` - Debug utilities (logs, state inspection)

Frontend communicates via `gameApi.ts` service using axios/tanstack-query.
